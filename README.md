# Spectrum
*Applying image processing to sound in [Python](https://www.python.org/).*

A small Python software which builds a spectrogram from an audio waveform, processes spectral data as an image, and turns it back into a waveform. Creates otherwise unachievable sounds.  

**Checklist:**
 - Roadmap:
	 - ✅ Reading an audio file
	 - ✅ Building the spectrum of a sample
	 - ❌ Building the spectrogram of a sample
	 - ❌ Apply image transformations
	 - ❌ Reconstruct sound from a spectrogram
	 - ❌ Exporting to an audio file
 - Supported audio file formats:
	 - ✅ WAV
	 - ❌ MP3
	 - ❌ OGG
	 - ❌ FLAC
 - Image transformations:
	 - ❌ Skewing
	 - ❌ Gaussian blur
	 - ❌ Spectral delay (generalisation of skewing)
	 - ❌ Compression
 - Audio effects:
	 - ❌ Equalizer
	 - ❌ Reverb
	 - ❌ Delay
	 - ❌ Compressor
